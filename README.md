# Cardio Monotor

Cardio Monotor is a web app that helps you to find out whether you are at a risk of developing a heart disease. **the model used for prediction has the accuracy of 92%.**


Over the last few decades, heart disease is the most common cause of global death. So early detection of heart disease and continuous monitoring can reduce the mortality rate. The exponential growth of data from different sources such as wearable sensor devices used in Internet of Things health monitoring, streaming system and others have been generating an enormous amount of data on a continuous basis. The combination of streaming big data analytics and machine learning is a breakthrough technology that can have a significant impact in healthcare field especially early detection of heart disease. This technology can be more powerful and less expensive. To overcome this issue,realtime heart disease prediction system based on apache Spark/ real time input data which stand as a strong large scale distributed computing platform that can be used successfully for streaming data event against machine learning through in-memory computations.
